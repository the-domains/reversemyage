**Age reversal is real.** You can now wind back the biological clock.

Sisel TSX is a Telomere enzyme supplement that is proven to work.

Telomere shortening is a primary cause of aging

**What are Telomeres?**

This information is courtesy of [http://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-telomere][0].

Telomeres are distinctive structures found at the ends of our chromosomes. They consist of the same short DNA sequence repeated over and over again.

**What do telomeres do?**

Telomeres serve three major purposes:

1\. They help to organise each of our 46 chromosomes in the [nucleus][1] (control centre) of our [cells][2].

2.They protect the ends of our chromosomes by forming a cap, much like the plastic tip on shoelaces. If the telomeres were not there, our chromosomes may end up sticking to other chromosomes.

3\. They allow the chromosome to be replicated properly during [cell division?][3]

**What happens to telomeres as we age?**

1\. Each time a cell divides, 25-200 bases are lost from the ends of the telomeres on each chromosome. Two main factors contribute to telomere shortening during [cell division][3]:

**How is telomere length maintained?**

\* [Telomerase?][4] is an [enzyme?][5] that adds the TTAGGG telomere sequence to the ends of chromosomes.

\* Telomerase is only found in very low concentrations in our [somatic cells?][6]. Because these cells do not regularly use telomerase they age leading to a reduction in normal function.

\* The result of ageing cells, is an ageing body.

\* Telomerase is found in high levels in [germline?][7] cells (egg and sperm) and stem cells. In these cells telomere length is maintained after DNA replication and the cells do not show signs of ageing.

\* Telomerase is also found in high levels in [cancer?][8] cells. This enables cancer cells to be immortal and continue replicating themselves. If telomerase activity was switched off in cancer cells, their telomeres would shorten until they reached a 'critical length'. This would, prevent the cancer cells from dividing uncontrollably to form tumours.

\* The action of telomerase allows cells to keep multiplying and avoid ageing.

## TSX 

## Advanced telomere support supplement

The potency of Sisel TS-X comes from the extracts of Astragalus and Bacopa (Brahmi).

Astragalus is a very powerful Chinese adaptogen and anti-oxidant. Adaptogens allow your body to adapt to mental, physical and emotional stress. Astragalus helps to lengthen the telomeres and protects them from dangerous free radicals.

SISEL uses superior extracts of the Astragalus that includes astragalosides and cycloastrogenol all of which have potent anti-in­ammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Early research also suggests that astragalus may be effective for type 2 diabetes, maintaining a healthy heart, decreasing the symptoms of seasonal allergies, overall protective health of our cells and helping people with their energy and athletic performance.

The second robust ingredient in TS-X is Bacopa monnieri. This fabulous herb from India has wonderful antioxidant properties and has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for years. Bacopa has been touted as a brain tonic that supports memory development, learning, focus and concentration.

TS-X also packs powerful anti-oxidants in the form of multiple high grade pigmented fruit and vegetable extracts along with turmeric and its main component curcumin. Curcumin is a highly potent anti-oxidant and anti-in­ammatory. Curcumin has shown promise in studies done with dementia, depression, heart disease, cancer and arthritis. (4)

"I have been taking the TSX since Feb. 2012\. Every year I do a health fair and I compare my results from 2011 to this year's results. My hearing and eyesight have improved and my normal hair color is coming back. I feel great and love avoiding the effects of aging." M Stafford
