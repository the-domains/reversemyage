Age reversal is real. You can now wind back the biological clock.

Sisel TSX is a Telomere enzyme supplement that is proven to work.

Telomere shortening is a primary cause of aging

**What are Telomeres?**

This information is courtesy of [http://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-telomere][0].

Telomeres are distinctive structures found at the ends of our chromosomes. They consist of the same short DNA sequence repeated over and over again.

**What do telomeres do?**

Telomeres serve three major purposes:

1\. They help to organise each of our 46 chromosomes in the [nucleus][1] (control centre) of our [cells][2].

2.They protect the ends of our chromosomes by forming a cap, much like the plastic tip on shoelaces. If the telomeres were not there, our chromosomes may end up sticking to other chromosomes.

3\. They allow the chromosome to be replicated properly during [cell division?][3]:
